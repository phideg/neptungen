# About

Neptungen is a static Website generator. Initially it was implemented to generate the website of the `TSC Neptun Bruehl` divers club.  

However it can be adapted and used for a lot of other use cases. For example for a personal blog or documentation as this one here.  

The template for this documentation was derived from the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) project.
