Yet another static Website Generator

# Why
Have you ever designed a static website for your club or one of your relatives but you don't want to maintain the contents for them? Well most static website generators are either dedicated to bloggers or they are too complicated to be used by non digital natives. 

Neptungen should be easy to use and minutes to set up even if you aren't an experienced web developer.
